    PRACTICAL CLASS: WEDNESDAY/ 6-8 PM 

# INTRODUCTION 

This project is to reflect the software enginnering pattern that follow good modularity design pattern, version control and testing of code. It consist of three module i.e Numerical, Generation and Main module that are design to calculate life path number, lucky colour and also to find the generation based on the birth

# Module Description 

Module generally refers to the component of the program for easy replacement. To tackle the problem statement of this project, I am designing the 3 module named Generation Module, Numerology Module and Main module which is described below:

1. Numerology module:
    Module Name: Numerical.py
    Description: This module handle the all the logical part of my program to check **life path number**, **identify master number** and **determining the lucky color based on the life path number**.
